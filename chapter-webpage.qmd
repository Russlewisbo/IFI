## Introduction to Invasive Fungal Infections

### The Global Burden of Fungal Disease

Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) represent a significant and growing threat to global health. While often overlooked compared to bacterial and viral pathogens, fungi cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly among immunocompromised populations [@brown2012].

::: {.callout-important}
## Key Statistics
- Over 1 million deaths annually from invasive fungal infections worldwide
- Fungal infections kill more people than malaria and are equivalent to tuberculosis deaths
- The burden is likely underestimated due to diagnostic challenges
:::

### Spectrum of Fungal Diseases

Fungal infections can be categorized by their anatomical involvement and host immune status:

| Type | Location | Examples | Primary Hosts |
|------|----------|----------|---------------|
| Superficial mycoses | Epidermis, hair, nails | Dermatophytosis, pityriasis | Immunocompetent |
| Subcutaneous mycoses | Dermis, subcutaneous tissue | Sporotrichosis, chromoblastomycosis | Immunocompetent (trauma) |
| Systemic mycoses from primary pathogens | Deep organs | Histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis | Immunocompetent & compromised |
| Systemic mycoses from opportunistic pathogens | Deep organs | Candidiasis, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis | Immunocompromised |

: Classification of Mycoses {#tbl-mycoses-classification}

### WHO Fungal Priority Pathogens List (2022)

The World Health Organization released its first fungal priority pathogens list in 2022, categorizing fungi by public health importance [@who2022]:

::: {.callout-note}

:::

## Antifungal Therapies

### Evolution of Antifungal Development

The development of systemic antifungal agents has progressed significantly since the introduction of amphotericin B in 1958:

| Era | Year(s) | Agents | Target |
|-----|---------|--------|--------|
| Early | 1958 | Amphotericin B deoxycholate | Ergosterol binding |
| Azole development | 1981-1992 | Ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole | Lanosterol 14-α-demethylase |
| Lipid formulations | 1990s | L-AMB, ABLC, ABCD | Ergosterol (reduced toxicity) |
| Expanded-spectrum azoles | 2002-2015 | Voriconazole, posaconazole, isavuconazole | Lanosterol 14-α-demethylase |
| Echinocandins | 2001-2006 | Caspofungin, micafungin, anidulafungin | β-1,3-glucan synthase |
| Novel agents | 2023+ | Ibrexafungerp, rezafungin, olorofim | Various new targets |

: Timeline of Antifungal Development {#tbl-antifungal-timeline}

### Mechanisms of Action

Antifungal agents target distinct components of the fungal cell:

**Cell Membrane Targets:**

- **Polyenes** (amphotericin B): Bind ergosterol, creating pores that lead to cell death
- **Azoles**: Inhibit lanosterol 14-α-demethylase (CYP51), disrupting ergosterol synthesis

**Cell Wall Targets:**

- **Echinocandins**: Inhibit β-1,3-glucan synthase, disrupting cell wall integrity

::: {.callout-tip}
## Clinical Pearl
The spectrum of antifungal activity varies significantly between drug classes:

- **Fluconazole**: Most *Candida* spp. (not *C. krusei*, reduced activity vs *C. glabrata*); no mold activity
- **Voriconazole/Isavuconazole/Posaconazole**: Broad *Candida* coverage + *Aspergillus*; posaconazole and isavuconazole have Mucorales activity
- **Echinocandins**: *Candida* spp. (including *C. glabrata*) + *Aspergillus*; no *Cryptococcus* or Mucorales activity
- **Amphotericin B**: Broadest spectrum - most yeasts and molds including Mucorales
:::

### Antifungal Tissue Distribution {#sec-tissue-distribution}

Understanding antifungal tissue penetration is critical for selecting appropriate therapy [@felton2014]:

| Drug | CSF | Eye/Vitreous | Urine | Lung ELF |
|------|-----|--------------|-------|----------|
| Fluconazole | +++ | +++ | +++ | ++ |
| Voriconazole | ++ | ++ | + | +++ |
| Posaconazole | + | + | - | +++ |
| Isavuconazole | + | + | - | +++ |
| Amphotericin B | +/- | +/- | + | ++ |
| Echinocandins | - | - | - | + |

: Antifungal Tissue Penetration {#tbl-tissue-penetration}

::: {.callout-warning}
## Important Consideration
Echinocandins have poor CNS, eye, and urine penetration. They should not be used as monotherapy for infections at these sites.
:::

## Invasive Candidiasis {#sec-candidiasis}

### Epidemiology

Invasive candidiasis is the most common invasive fungal infection in hospitalized patients. The epidemiology has evolved significantly over recent decades [@pappas2018]:

**Species Distribution:**

- *Candida albicans*: 40-60% (decreasing)
- *Candida glabrata*: 15-25% (increasing, especially with azole exposure)
- *Candida parapsilosis*: 10-20% (associated with central lines, TPN)
- *Candida tropicalis*: 5-10% (more common in neutropenic patients)
- *Candida krusei*: 2-5% (intrinsically fluconazole-resistant)
- *Candida auris*: Emerging multidrug-resistant threat

### Risk Factors

::: {.callout-note}
## Major Risk Factors for Invasive Candidiasis

**Host Factors:**

- Neutropenia
- Diabetes mellitus
- Extremes of age
- Recent surgery (especially abdominal)
- Burns

**Healthcare Exposures:**

- Central venous catheters
- Total parenteral nutrition
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics
- ICU admission >3 days
- Prior colonization with *Candida*

**Medications:**

- Corticosteroids
- Immunosuppressive agents
- Prior antifungal exposure
:::

### Pathogenesis

*Candida* species are commensal organisms of the human gastrointestinal tract, skin, and mucous membranes. Invasive disease occurs when host defenses are compromised or mucosal barriers are breached.

**Key Pathogenic Steps:**

1. Colonization of mucosal surfaces
2. Breach of mucosal barrier (surgery, mucositis, catheters)
3. Bloodstream invasion
4. Dissemination to deep organs
5. Biofilm formation (especially on devices)

### Clinical Presentations

**Candidemia:**

- Fever unresponsive to antibiotics
- Often no localizing signs
- May have metastatic complications (endophthalmitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis)

**Deep-seated Candidiasis:**

- Hepatosplenic candidiasis (chronic disseminated): Fever, elevated alkaline phosphatase, target lesions on imaging
- Candida peritonitis: Abdominal surgery, peritoneal dialysis
- Candida endocarditis: Prosthetic valves, IV drug use

### Diagnosis {#sec-candida-diagnosis}

::: {.callout-important}
## The "Missing 50%"
Blood cultures detect only approximately 50% of invasive candidiasis cases, highlighting the need for adjunctive diagnostic methods [@clancy2013].
:::

**Culture-Based Methods:**

- Blood cultures: Gold standard but limited sensitivity
- Tissue cultures: Higher yield but require invasive sampling

**Non-Culture Diagnostics:**

| Test | Sensitivity | Specificity | Comments |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| β-D-glucan | 75-80% | 80% | Pan-fungal; false positives with dialysis, gauze, some antibiotics |
| T2Candida Panel | 91% | 99% | Direct from blood; rapid results; detects 5 common species |
| Candida PCR | 85-95% | 90-95% | Not widely standardized |

: Non-Culture Diagnostics for Invasive Candidiasis {#tbl-candida-diagnostics}

### Treatment {#sec-candida-treatment}

#### Initial Therapy

Treatment selection depends on patient stability, prior azole exposure, and suspected species [@pappas2016]:

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-candida-algorithm
%%| fig-cap: "Treatment Algorithm for Candidemia"

    F -->|Other susceptible| I[Step-down to Fluconazole if stable]
```

#### Source Control

::: {.callout-warning}
## Critical Intervention
Central venous catheter removal is associated with improved outcomes and should be performed whenever feasible in patients with candidemia.
:::

#### Duration of Therapy

- **Uncomplicated candidemia**: 14 days after first negative blood culture and resolution of symptoms
- **Deep-seated infection**: Extended duration based on site (e.g., endocarditis: 6 weeks post-valve surgery)

#### Ophthalmologic Examination

All patients with candidemia should receive a dilated funduscopic examination to evaluate for endophthalmitis:

- **Timing**: Within 1 week of diagnosis (after neutrophil recovery in neutropenic patients)
- **Finding**: Chorioretinal lesions with or without vitritis
- **Management**: Extended antifungal therapy; ophthalmology consultation

### Antifungal Susceptibility Testing

Susceptibility testing is recommended for all bloodstream isolates. CLSI and EUCAST breakpoints guide interpretation:

| Species | Fluconazole | Echinocandins | Comments |
|---------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| *C. albicans* | S ≤2 | S ≤0.25 | Usually susceptible |
| *C. glabrata* | SDD ≤32 | S ≤0.12 | Dose-dependent; check echinocandin susceptibility |
| *C. krusei* | R (intrinsic) | S ≤0.25 | Use echinocandin or amphotericin B |
| *C. parapsilosis* | S ≤2 | Higher MICs (S ≤2) | Fluconazole often preferred |
| *C. auris* | Often R | Variable | Requires individualized testing |

: CLSI Breakpoints for Candida Species (mg/L) {#tbl-candida-breakpoints}

## Cryptococcosis {#sec-cryptococcosis}

### Epidemiology

Cryptococcosis is caused by encapsulated yeasts of the *Cryptococcus* species complex. It remains a leading cause of mortality in HIV-infected individuals, particularly in resource-limited settings [@park2009; @tugume2023].

**Global Burden:**

- Approximately 220,000 cases of cryptococcal meningitis annually
- 180,000 deaths per year
- Most cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa
- Leading cause of meningitis in adults with HIV in Africa

### Species and Ecology

| Species | Primary Host | Geographic Distribution | Clinical Association |
|---------|--------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| *C. neoformans* | Immunocompromised (HIV, transplant) | Worldwide | Soil, bird droppings |
| *C. gattii* | Immunocompetent & immunocompromised | Pacific Northwest, Australia, tropics | Eucalyptus trees |

: Cryptococcus Species Characteristics {#tbl-crypto-species}

### Pathogenesis

*Cryptococcus* has several virulence factors that enable evasion of host defenses:

1. **Polysaccharide capsule**: Antiphagocytic; immunomodulatory
2. **Melanin production**: Antioxidant protection
3. **Ability to survive within macrophages**: Trojan horse mechanism for CNS penetration
4. **Titan cells**: Large cells resistant to phagocytosis

### Clinical Manifestations

**Cryptococcal Meningitis:**

- Subacute presentation over 1-2 weeks
- Headache (most common)
- Fever
- Altered mental status
- Neck stiffness (less common than bacterial meningitis)
- Cranial nerve palsies
- Visual disturbances

::: {.callout-important}
## Elevated Intracranial Pressure
Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in cryptococcal meningitis. Opening pressure >25 cm H₂O is associated with poor outcomes.
:::

**Pulmonary Cryptococcosis:**

- May be asymptomatic (incidental finding)
- Cough, dyspnea, chest pain
- Nodules or infiltrates on imaging

**Disseminated Disease:**

- Skin lesions (umbilicated papules resembling molluscum)
- Bone involvement
- Prostate (sanctuary site)

### Diagnosis

**Lumbar Puncture Findings:**

- Opening pressure: Often elevated (>20 cm H₂O)
- WBC: Elevated (lymphocyte predominant)
- Glucose: Low
- Protein: Elevated

**Diagnostic Tests:**

| Test | Sensitivity | Specificity | Comments |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| CSF CrAg (lateral flow) | 99% | 99% | Rapid, point-of-care |
| Serum CrAg | 99% | 99% | Can be positive before symptoms |
| CSF India ink | 75-85% | >95% | Visualizes capsule; less sensitive |
| CSF culture | 95% | 100% | Gold standard; takes 3-7 days |

: Diagnostic Tests for Cryptococcosis {#tbl-crypto-diagnostics}

::: {.callout-tip}
## Screening Recommendation
Serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) screening is recommended for HIV-infected individuals with CD4 <100 cells/μL to identify subclinical disease before symptom onset.
:::

### Treatment

#### The AMBITION Trial

The AMBITION trial established single high-dose liposomal amphotericin B as the preferred induction regimen [@jarvis2022]:

**Key Findings:**

- Single dose L-AMB (10 mg/kg) + 14 days flucytosine + fluconazole was non-inferior to 7-day amphotericin B deoxycholate regimens
- 10-week mortality: 24.8% vs 28.7% (difference -3.9%, 95% CI -10.4 to 2.6)
- Fewer adverse events with single-dose regimen
- Simplified administration

#### Treatment Regimens

**Induction (2 weeks):**

1. **Preferred**: Single dose liposomal amphotericin B (10 mg/kg) + flucytosine (100 mg/kg/day) + fluconazole (1200 mg/day)
2. **Alternative**: Amphotericin B deoxycholate (1 mg/kg/day) + flucytosine (100 mg/kg/day) × 7 days

**Consolidation (8 weeks):**

- Fluconazole 800 mg/day

**Maintenance:**

- Fluconazole 200 mg/day until immune reconstitution (CD4 >100 for 3 months on ART)

#### Management of Elevated ICP

::: {.callout-warning}
## Critical Intervention
Aggressive management of elevated intracranial pressure is essential for survival. Therapeutic lumbar punctures should be performed to reduce opening pressure by 50% or to <20 cm H₂O.
:::

**Approach:**

1. Daily lumbar punctures initially if opening pressure >25 cm H₂O
2. Remove sufficient CSF to reduce pressure by 50% or to normal
3. Consider lumbar drain or VP shunt for refractory cases
4. Avoid corticosteroids (associated with worse outcomes)
5. Acetazolamide and mannitol are not effective

### Prognosis

Factors associated with poor outcome [@williamson2017]:

- High CSF fungal burden
- Altered mental status at presentation
- Elevated opening pressure
- Low CSF white cell count
- Underlying malignancy
- Inadequate ICP management

## Invasive Aspergillosis {#sec-aspergillosis}

### Spectrum of Aspergillus Diseases

The clinical manifestations of *Aspergillus* infection depend on host immune status:

**Immunocompromised Hosts (Immune Dysfunction):**

- Acute invasive aspergillosis
- Subacute invasive aspergillosis

**Normal Immune Function (Middle of Spectrum):**

- Tracheobronchitis
- Aspergilloma
- Chronic cavitary aspergillosis
- Chronic fibrosing aspergillosis

**Immune Hyperactivity:**

- Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)
- Allergic fungal sinusitis

### Aspergillus Species

| Species | Frequency | Clinical Significance |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| *A. fumigatus* | 70-80% | Most common cause of IA |
| *A. flavus* | 10-15% | More common in sinusitis; produces aflatoxins |
| *A. niger* | 5-10% | Otomycosis; may produce aspergillomas |
| *A. terreus* | 2-5% | Intrinsically amphotericin B resistant |
| *A. nidulans* | Rare | Associated with chronic granulomatous disease |

: Common Aspergillus Species {#tbl-aspergillus-species}

### Mode of Acquisition

*Aspergillus* conidia (2-3 μm) are ubiquitous in the environment and inhaled daily. In immunocompetent hosts, conidia are cleared by:

1. Mucociliary clearance
2. Alveolar macrophage phagocytosis
3. Neutrophil killing of germinating hyphae

### Risk Factors

::: {.callout-note}
## Major Risk Factors for Invasive Aspergillosis

**Host Factors:**

- Severe and prolonged neutropenia (≥3 weeks)
- Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (especially allogeneic)
- Solid organ transplant (especially lung)
- Chronic granulomatous disease
- Advanced AIDS

**Iatrogenic:**

- High-dose corticosteroids (≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalent)
- Ibrutinib and other BTK inhibitors
- T-cell depleting therapies

**Emerging Risk Groups:**

- COPD with corticosteroid therapy
- ICU patients (especially with influenza or COVID-19)
- Liver cirrhosis
:::

### Pathogenesis

#### Bronchial-Alveolar Phase

Initial invasion occurs through bronchial and alveolar walls:

- Conidia germinate in airways
- Hyphae invade bronchial/alveolar epithelium
- Associated inflammation
- CT findings: Centrilobular nodules, tree-in-bud pattern
- Low fungal burden; serum galactomannan often negative
- BAL galactomannan/culture may be positive

#### Angioinvasive Phase

In severely immunocompromised patients, disease progresses to angioinvasion:

**Progression Timeline:**

| Day | Pathology | CT Finding | Biomarkers |
|-----|-----------|------------|------------|
| 0-3 | Hyphal tissue invasion | Macronodule ± halo sign | GM may be negative |
| 5-7 | Hemorrhage, infarction | Dense consolidation | Serum GM positive |
| 10-12 | Extensive necrosis | Hypodense sign | High fungal burden |
| 15-18 | Neutrophil recovery, cavitation | Air-crescent sign | May persist |

: Temporal Progression of Angioinvasive Aspergillosis {#tbl-ia-progression}

### Clinical Presentation

**Pulmonary Aspergillosis:**

- Fever unresponsive to antibiotics
- Pleuritic chest pain
- Cough, hemoptysis
- Dyspnea

**Sinus Aspergillosis:**

- Facial pain
- Nasal congestion/discharge
- Periorbital swelling
- Black eschar on nasal examination

**Disseminated Aspergillosis:**

- CNS involvement (ring-enhancing lesions, abscesses)
- Cutaneous lesions
- Multiple organ involvement

### Diagnosis

#### Imaging

**CT Findings Suggestive of IPA:**

- Nodules with halo sign (ground-glass surrounding dense core)
- Air-crescent sign (late finding with neutrophil recovery)
- Wedge-shaped infiltrates
- Cavitation

::: {.callout-tip}
## Halo Sign
The halo sign (ground-glass attenuation surrounding a nodule) is relatively specific for angioinvasive mold infection in neutropenic patients, particularly in the first week of infection.
:::

**CT Pulmonary Angiography (Vessel Occlusion Sign):**

- Can help differentiate IPA from other pulmonary processes
- Positive VOS shows vessel truncation within or adjacent to nodules

#### Laboratory Diagnosis

**Culture and Histopathology:**

- BAL culture: Sensitivity 50-60%
- Tissue biopsy: Septate hyphae with acute-angle (45°) branching
- PAS and GMS stains highlight fungal elements

**Galactomannan Testing:**

| Sample | Cutoff | Sensitivity | Specificity | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Serum | ≥0.5 ODI | 70-80% | 85-90% | Better in neutropenic patients |
| BAL | ≥1.0 ODI | 85-90% | 90-95% | Higher sensitivity than serum |

: Galactomannan Testing Performance {#tbl-gm-testing}

::: {.callout-warning}
## False Positives
Galactomannan false positives can occur with:

- Piperacillin-tazobactam (older formulations)
- Mucositis
- Certain foods
- Cross-reactivity with other fungi (*Fusarium*, *Histoplasma*)
:::

**Other Biomarkers:**

- **β-D-glucan**: Less specific (pan-fungal); may be useful in combination
- **Aspergillus PCR**: High sensitivity; not yet standardized

### Treatment

#### First-Line Therapy

Triazoles with mold activity are preferred for primary therapy [@thompson2021nejm]:

**If NO Prior Mold-Active Prophylaxis:**

- Voriconazole (loading: 6 mg/kg IV q12h × 2 doses; maintenance: 4 mg/kg IV q12h or 200-300 mg PO q12h)
- Isavuconazole (loading: 200 mg q8h × 6 doses; maintenance: 200 mg daily)
- Posaconazole (300 mg IV/PO q12h × 2 doses, then 300 mg daily)

**If Receiving Posaconazole Prophylaxis:**

- Liposomal amphotericin B (3-5 mg/kg/day) initially
- Reassess triazole failure: drug levels, resistance, alternative diagnosis
- Consider switching to alternative triazole if isolate is susceptible and patient stabilizes

#### Antifungal Resistance

Triazole resistance in *Aspergillus fumigatus* is an emerging concern:

::: {.callout-important}
## Azole Resistance
Environmental azole resistance (TR34/L98H and TR46/Y121F/T289A mutations) is increasing globally due to agricultural fungicide use. Rates vary by region:

- Netherlands: 5-15%
- UK: 5-10%
- Germany: 3-5%
- United States: 1-3%
- Some Asian regions: Up to 30%

Consider resistance testing in refractory cases or high-prevalence regions.
:::

#### Duration

- **Minimum**: 6-12 weeks
- **Continue until**: Resolution of all lesions, reversal of immunosuppression
- **Secondary prophylaxis**: Consider during subsequent immunosuppression

### Prognosis

Key prognostic factors:

- Early diagnosis and prompt antifungal therapy
- Recovery from neutropenia/immune suppression
- Underlying disease status
- Site of infection (CNS involvement = worse prognosis)
- Triazole resistance

## Other Mold Infections

### Fusariosis

*Fusarium* species are emerging pathogens causing severe infections in neutropenic patients.

**Key Features:**

- Most common scenario: Persistent neutropenia
- Common species: *F. solani* complex (50%), *F. oxysporum* (14%), *F. verticillioides* (10-11%)
- Characteristic finding: Metastatic skin lesions
- **Positive blood cultures in 30-50% of cases** (unlike other mold infections)
- Macroconidia are classic (banana-shaped)

**Treatment:**

- High-dose liposomal amphotericin B ± voriconazole
- Neutrophil recovery is critical
- G-CSF may be beneficial

::: {.callout-note}
## Fusarium Outbreak
A multinational outbreak (185 exposed, 9 cases) of nosocomial *Fusarium solani* meningitis occurred among immunocompetent patients who underwent surgery with epidural anesthesia in Mexico in 2023 [@strong2024]. The pathogen showed high predilection for the brainstem and vertebrobasilar arterial system, with high mortality from vessel injury.
:::

### Mucormycosis {#sec-mucormycosis}

#### Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Mucormycosis is caused by fungi of the order Mucorales, including *Rhizopus*, *Mucor*, *Lichtheimia*, and others.

**Risk Factors:**

- Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (especially ketoacidosis)
- Hematologic malignancy with neutropenia
- Hematopoietic stem cell transplant
- Solid organ transplant
- Iron overload states
- Deferoxamine therapy (acts as a siderophore)
- Trauma, burns
- COVID-19 (especially in India, 2021 outbreak)

#### Common Species

| Genus | Clinical Significance |
|-------|----------------------|
| *Rhizopus* spp. | Most common (especially *R. arrhizus*) |
| *Mucor* spp. | Less common but significant |
| *Lichtheimia* spp. | Common in immunocompromised |
| *Rhizomucor* spp. | More aggressive disease |
| *Cunninghamella* spp. | Disseminated disease; very poor prognosis |
| *Apophysomyces* spp. | Cutaneous/soft tissue (trauma) |

: Common Mucorales Species {#tbl-mucorales-species}

#### Pathogenesis

Mucorales have a unique relationship with iron:

1. Spores inhaled, deposited in nasal turbinates or alveoli
2. Macrophages attempt phagocytosis (impaired by glucocorticoids)
3. Neutrophils damage hyphal forms; iron acquisition supports proliferation
4. **Angioinvasion** leads to thrombosis, hemorrhage, and tissue necrosis
5. Hyperglycemia, acidosis, and free iron facilitate growth

::: {.callout-warning}
## Deferoxamine Risk
Iron chelation with deferoxamine increases mucormycosis risk (fungus uses it as a xenosiderophore). Newer chelating agents like deferasirox do not carry this risk.
:::

#### Clinical Manifestations

**Rhinocerebral Mucormycosis:**

- Most common form in diabetic patients
- Begins with sinusitis, facial pain
- Rapid progression with necrotic eschar (black eschar = late finding)
- Orbital involvement: Proptosis, vision loss
- Cavernous sinus thrombosis
- CNS extension: High mortality

**Pulmonary Mucormycosis:**

- More common in neutropenic patients
- Nodular infiltrates
- Reverse halo sign
- Pleural effusions
- Rapid progression

**Cutaneous Mucormycosis:**

- Trauma, burns, surgical wounds
- Natural disasters (e.g., Joplin tornado)
- Combat injuries
- Necrotizing soft tissue infection

#### Diagnosis

::: {.callout-important}
## Diagnostic Limitations
Serum β-D-glucan and galactomannan do NOT detect Mucorales. These tests being negative does not exclude mucormycosis.
:::

**Diagnostic Approach:**

- Histopathology: Wide (6-16 μm), ribbon-like, pauciseptate hyphae with right-angle branching
- Culture: Rapid growth ("lid lifter"); confirm species identification
- PCR/sequencing: Available in some centers
- MALDI-TOF: For isolate identification

**Imaging:**

- MRI: "Black turbinate sign" (devitalized tissue in sinuses)
- CT: Reverse halo sign in pulmonary disease

#### Treatment

**Principles:**

1. **Surgical debridement**: Essential; often requires multiple operations
2. **Reversal of predisposing conditions**: Glucose control, reduce immunosuppression
3. **Antifungal therapy**: Start immediately

**Antifungal Regimen:**

- **Initial**: Liposomal amphotericin B 5-10 mg/kg/day
- **Step-down**: Posaconazole or isavuconazole (for patients responding or with toxicity)
- **Duration**: Prolonged; minimum until clinical/radiographic resolution

::: {.callout-tip}
## Treatment Pearls
- Higher doses of L-AMB (10 mg/kg/day) may be considered for CNS involvement
- Combination therapy (L-AMB + posaconazole/isavuconazole) is sometimes used but not proven superior
- Surgical debridement should not be delayed for imaging; early aggressive surgery improves outcomes
:::

#### Prognosis

Mucormycosis carries significant morbidity and mortality:

- Overall mortality: 40-80% depending on form and host
- Rhinocerebral with CNS extension: >80% mortality
- Disseminated disease: >90% mortality
- Factors improving survival: Early diagnosis, surgical debridement, immune recovery

::: {.callout-note}
## Healthcare Professional Survey
In a Twitter poll of 1,885 infectious disease specialists, 44% rated mucormycosis as the "scariest" infectious disease, more than *Candida auris* (18%), *Staphylococcus aureus* (24%), or SARS-CoV-2 (14%).
:::

## Antifungal Toxicities {#sec-toxicities}

### Amphotericin B Toxicities

#### Nephrotoxicity

Amphotericin B deoxycholate causes significant nephrotoxicity through multiple mechanisms:

1. **Afferent arteriole constriction**: Reduced renal blood flow
2. **Tubuloglomerular feedback**: Further vasoconstriction
3. **Direct tubular toxicity**: LDL-bound AMB accumulates via LDL receptors
4. **Electrolyte wasting**: K⁺, Mg²⁺, Na⁺ loss

**Clinical Impact:**

- ≥2-fold increase in serum creatinine in 26% of patients receiving AMB deoxycholate
- Severe electrolyte abnormalities common

#### Liposomal Formulation Advantages

Liposomal amphotericin B reduces nephrotoxicity:

- Liposomes do not undergo glomerular filtration
- Reduced binding to LDL receptors
- ≥2-fold SCr increase in only 10% of patients
- Allows higher dosing when needed

#### Infusion-Related Reactions

- Fever, rigors, chills
- Hypotension
- More common with deoxycholate formulation
- Premedication with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine may help

### Triazole Toxicities

| Toxicity | Most Commonly Associated Agent(s) |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| Hepatotoxicity | All azoles (highest with voriconazole) |
| QTc prolongation | All azoles (less with isavuconazole) |
| Visual disturbances (photopsia) | Voriconazole |

## Monitoring Recommendations
- Liver function tests at baseline and periodically during therapy
- Trough drug levels for voriconazole (target 1-5 μg/mL), posaconazole (>1 μg/mL), and isavuconazole (if concerns about efficacy/toxicity)
- ECG at baseline if risk factors for QTc prolongation
- Visual symptoms inquiry for voriconazole patients

## Summary and Key Points

::: {.callout-important}
## Take-Home Messages

**Invasive Candidiasis:**

- Blood cultures miss 50% of cases; use adjunctive diagnostics
- Source control (catheter removal) improves outcomes
- Echinocandins are first-line for unstable patients
- Dilated eye exam for all patients with candidemia

**Cryptococcosis:**

- CrAg screening for HIV patients with CD4 <100
- Single high-dose L-AMB (AMBITION regimen) is preferred
- Aggressive ICP management is critical
- Avoid corticosteroids

**Invasive Aspergillosis:**

- Early CT and galactomannan testing in high-risk patients
- Voriconazole, isavuconazole, or posaconazole for primary therapy
- Use L-AMB if breakthrough on azole prophylaxis
- Monitor for azole resistance

**Mucormycosis:**

- β-D-glucan and galactomannan do NOT detect Mucorales
- Surgical debridement is essential
- High-dose liposomal amphotericin B (5-10 mg/kg/day)
- Control underlying conditions (diabetes, immunosuppression)
